    <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
    <p>
        The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and
        methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <h3>Dialogs</h3>
        <li>The <b>window.alert()</b> method will pause the execution of the program and display
            a message in a dialog box.</li>
        <p>
            Click <button onclick="sendAlert()">HERE</button> to see an example.
        </p>
        <li>The<b>window.confirm()</b> method will stop the execution of the program and
            display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument,
            and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean values of true if
            the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel</li>
        <p>
            Click <button onclick="sendConfirm()">HERE</button> to see an example.
        </p>

        <li>The<b>window.prompt()</b> method will stop the execution of the program. It displays
            a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field
            that allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as a string when the
            user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned</li>
        <p>
            Click <button onclick="sendPrompt()">HERE</button> to see an example.
        </p>

    </ul>
    <h3>The Document Object</h3>

    <ul>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer.</p>
        <p>This means that a browser does not remember anything from one request to
            another. So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is
            remembered. Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information
            that can then be retrieved between requests.</p>
        <p>Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user
            preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart),
            authentication and tracking users.</p>

        <h4>Timing Functions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>setTimeout()</b>method accepts a callback to a function as its first
                    parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter. Try entering the
                    following example into a console.</p>
                <p>
                    Click <button onclick="setTime()">HERE</button> to see an example.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>window.setInterval()</b>method works in a similar way to
                    window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function
                    after every given number of milliseconds.</p>
                <p>
                    Click <button onclick="chant()">HERE</button> to see an example in the console
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Animation</h4>
        <p>
            The setTimeout() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements
            on a web page. As an example, let’s create a web page that shows a colored
            square, and make it rotate.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <div id='square'></div>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used to create
            web pages. The latest iteration is HTML 5.1, which finally became a W3C
            recommendation in November 2016.</p>
    </ul>

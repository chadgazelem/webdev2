            <h2>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>Errors
                    <li>System error - there’s a problem with the system or external devices with
                        which the program is interacting.</li>

                    <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it
                        could even be as simple as a typo.</li>

                    <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is
                        unable to handle.</li>
                </p>

            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>Exceptions</p>
            <li>is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the
                program to deal with the error.</li>

            <p>Warnings</p>
            <ul>
                <li>warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn’t enough to cause the
                    program to crash.</li>

            <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Writing
                    code in strict mode can also help improve its clarity and speed, since it follows
                    conventions and will throw exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used.</li>
                <li>Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a
                    JavaScript file</li>

            <h2>Debugging in the Browser</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then
                    dealing with them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Trusty Alert</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog
                    at certain points in the code.
                </li>
                <li>alert()</li>

            <p>Using the Console</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most modern JavaScript environments have a console object that provides a
                    360 JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition
                    number of methods for logging information and debugging.
